# Face-Recognition-Attendence-System
I have developed this face recognition Attendence system using Python. It is connected to an SQL database to store student details and attendence information.  OpenCV and PIL libraries are used to capture the faces of student and store them in an image file. LBPH Face recognizer algorithm is used which is one of the easiest algorithms for face detection. HaarCascade frontal face algorithm is used which identifies the faces in an image.Tkinter is used to create user interface and datetime library is used to record attendence in real time. This recorded attendence can be exported using an excel or csv file
